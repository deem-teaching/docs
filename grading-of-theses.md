# Grading

## Grading a Bachelor's Thesis

A Bachelor’s Thesis will be evaluated based on the following aspects: structure of the thesis, general comprehensibility, clarity of motivation and problem definition; Identification of technical challenges and the systematic approach solve them via a software solution; systematic experimental setup and result interpretation. 

 1. __Structure:__ The thesis should follow a top-down structure. The thesis should first introduce the background and the motivation of the problem to be solved. Then, the problem should be defined systematically, highlighting the research questions to be answered. These research questions should be answered by introducing scientific methods used to solve the problem. Finally, experiments should be designed to test the methodology and the result should be interpreted properly.
 1. __Language:__ The thesis should be comprehensible without significant amounts of grammar or spelling errors. Suitable technical terms should be used properly and defined if necessary. The thesis should follow a scientific writing style.
 1. __Motivation and background:__ The motivation should clearly stress the real-life motivation for solving the problem at hand. The motivation and problem definition should be rooted in existing literature, if possible. The technical difficulty should be emphasized.
 1. __Problem definition:__ The problem should be defined in a clear way that can be tested by designing experiments. The whole problem should be derived into one or several research questions.
 1. __Technical challenges:__ These chapters should introduce how the technical difficulties from the motivation are solved. This can be done by introducing the key components, algorithms or methodology used in the project. 
 1. __Experimental setup:__ The experiment should be scientifically defined and described, and then independently conducted. It should be able to test the performance of the proposed methodology on solving the problem. Innovation based on the existing work is encouraged.
 1. __Result:__ Suitable evaluation metrics should be selected as the final result. The result should be properly described and interpreted. The result should be clear and able to answer the research questions. A conclusion is expected based on the result interpretation.

Points will be deducted when a certain aspect cannot be fulfilled. At least half of the requirements should be fulfilled to pass the Bachelor’s Thesis. Frequent language mistakes that lead to an incomprehensible Thesis will result in failing to pass the Bachelor’s Thesis, regardless of the other requirements.

## Grading Master's Thesis

A Master’s Thesis will be evaluated based on the following aspects: structure of the thesis, general comprehensibility, clarity of motivation and problem definition; systematic literature review; identification of the technical challenges and the systematic approach solve it via them software solution; systematic experimental setup and result interpretation; complying to scientific writing; the independence and motivation in the work.

 1. __Structure:__ The thesis should follow a top-down structure. The thesis should first introduce the background and the motivation of the problem to be solved. Then, the related work should be introduced systematically and the challenges that will be tackled in this work should be discussed. The problem should be defined systematically, highlighting the research questions to be answered. These research questions should be answered by introducing scientific methods used to solve the problem. Finally, experiments should be designed to test the methodology and the result should be interpreted properly.
 1. __Motivation and background:__ The motivation should clearly stress the real-life motivation for solving the problem at hand. The motivation and problem definition should be rooted in existing literature, if possible. The challenges and technical difficulty should be emphasized.
 1. __Related work:__ A systematic literature review should be carried out. The student should be able to identify the related areas and search for the most significant related work. Every piece of related work should be summarized in a concise and comprehensive way. The advantages and limitations of previous work should be discussed. The relevance to this work and the improvement made in this work need to be pointed out.
 1. __Problem definition:__ The problem should be defined in a clear way that can be tested by designing experiments. The whole problem should be derived into one or several research questions.
 1. __Methodology:__ These chapters should introduce how the technical difficulties from the motivation are solved. This can be done by introducing the key components, algorithms, or methodology used in the project. The goal is to  expand beyond state-of-the-art. Every design decision should be discussed and supported with arguments or empirics.
 1. __Experimental setup:__ The experiment should be scientifically defined and described, and then independently conducted. Experimental questions and setup should match so that experiments support the claims of the thesis.
 1. __Result:__ Suitable evaluation metrics should be selected as the final result to support the claims. The results should be properly described and interpreted. A sound conclusion is expected based on the result interpretation.
 1. __Writing:__ The thesis should be comprehensible without significant amounts of grammar or spelling errors. Suitable technical terms should be used properly and defined if necessary. Every figure and table should be described and discussed in the text. Every statement should be justified. The thesis should follow a scientific writing style. 
 1. __Independence:__ The students need to show their independence and motivation in the work. The student is expected to show high independence in coming up with creative solutions and carrying out experiments.
    
Points will be deducted when a certain aspect cannot be fulfilled. At least half of the requirements should be fulfilled to pass the Master’s Thesis. Frequent language mistakes that lead to an incomprehensible thesis will result in failing to pass the Master’s Thesis, regardless of the other requirements.
