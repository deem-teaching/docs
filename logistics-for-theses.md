 * __Advisor__ - The research associate ("wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter") who will advise you throughout the thesis writing period. 
 * __First examiner__ (Professor Schelter) - The person who will grade your thesis and also supervise the writing process together with the Advisor. You will meet him approximately once per month.

## Apply for a Thesis Topic

All our available theses topics are listed on [theses.tu-berlin.de](https://www.theses.tu-berlin.de/de/theses?currentEvents%5Bfilter%5D%5Bcustom_value_institutes%5D%5B0%5D=ea5e3020-159b-4b46-9105-b4863e7ae807). Please apply through this portal if you want to write a thesis with us.

## Write a Thesis Proposal

Onvce you are approved for a thesis topic, the next step is to meet with your advisor and write a proposal for the thesis, based on our [thesis proposal template](template-for-thesis-proposal.md). The proposal should not be longer than four pages and should be discussed with the advisor before sending it to Prof. Schelter. 

## Registration of the Thesis:

Once Prof. Schelter approved your proposal, you should fill out the __registration form from the examination office__ to register your thesis. Conditions and procedures may vary depending on the study program. Please check your StuPO.

In general, the process is as follows for computer science students:

 1. You contact the examination team.
 1. You will receive a registration form, which you need to fill out and send using your TU email to your examination team.
 1. The examination office will check the prerequisites, complete their part of the form, and forward it to the first examiner (Prof. Dr. Abedjan).
 1. Prof. Dr. Schelter will specify the topic, suggest a second examiner, sign the form, and forward it to the examination board.
 1. The examination board will check if the application is formally correct and send the decision back to the examination office.
 1. You will receive information about the specific topic and the submission deadline by email (TU account) or by post.


## Submission of the Thesis

The formal procedure for submitting your thesis is described in your examination rules. Ask the examination office in doubt. Exclusive digital submission requires the consent of both examiners and must be planned beforehand.

Please note that the thesis MUST contain the following 

 * Declaration of independence (§ 60 Abs. 8 AllgStuPO)
> Hiermit erkläre ich, dass ich die vorliegende Arbeit selbstständig und eigenhändig sowie ohne unerlaubte fremde Hilfe und ausschließlich unter Verwendung der aufgeführten Quellen und Hilfsmittel angefertigt habe.
>
> Berlin, den DATE

> Signature
> 
> Last Name, First Name, Registration Number

Technical details on the submission process can be found at: [TU Berlin Examinations - Final Theses](https://www.tu.berlin/en/pruefungen/examinations/final-theses) and [Final Theses at Faculty IV (Submission of Final Thesis)](https://www.tu.berlin/en/eecs/academics-teaching/advising/finalizing-your-studies/final-theses-at-faculty-iv#c2112346).    

## Defense

You should set the defense date with your advisor. Usually, the defense is around one month after your deadline. For the defense session, you have 15 minutes to present your work. After that, we will have 10 minutes of questions and answers. Master thesis students are supposed to sign up for the "Research Seminar - Data Engineering for Machine Learning", where they also obtain 3 additional ungraded LPs. There are no predesigned templates for your slides. You can present your work in German or English.
